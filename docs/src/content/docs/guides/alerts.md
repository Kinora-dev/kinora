title: Alerts
description: Get notified on Slack, email, or a webhook when a run brings new failures or regressions.
---

Each project can send a notification when a run brings new failures or regressions. Alerts are
configured per project in the dashboard; there is nothing to add to your CI.

On cloud, alerts are a paid feature. **Self-host is unlimited** (`KINORA_CLOUD=false` turns every
feature on).

## Channels

A project can notify any combination of:

- **Slack** - connect a workspace with "Add to Slack", then pick a channel.
- **Email** - one or more addresses (needs SMTP configured on the server; see
  [Configuration](/self-hosting/configuration/) for the `SMTP_*` variables).
- **Webhook** - a custom URL that receives a JSON payload, for wiring alerts into your own
  systems.

Set them up under a project's alert settings in the dashboard.

## Policy

Each channel fires on one of three policies:

| Policy | Fires when |
| --- | --- |
| `always` | Every run, pass or fail. |
| `on-failure` | The run has any unexpected failure. |
| `on-regression` | The run has a test that is **newly failing or newly flaky** versus the previous run. |

`on-regression` is the quiet default for a healthy suite: it stays silent while things are green
and only pings you when something actually breaks or starts flaking.

## What's in an alert

- The project name and a link to the run in the dashboard.
- The run's pass/fail counts.
- The lists of newly failing and newly flaky tests (capped, with an "and N more" overflow).

Regressions are computed by comparing the run against the previous run on the same branch, so an
alert distinguishes a fresh break from a test that was already red.

## Bulk-imported runs

Runs pushed via `kinora import` do **not** trigger alerts, so backfilling history from an archive
never floods your channels.
